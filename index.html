<h2>My sumary </h2>
<p>Hey! I'm a 17-year-old from Peru who's all about exploring and creating. Traveling, drawing, and diving into Japanese studies are my jam. As university approaches, I'm excited to broaden my horizons. And guess what? I'm also delving into the world of web development, combining creativity with coding. Life's a canvas, and I'm painting it with adventures and innovation.</p>
